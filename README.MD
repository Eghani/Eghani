# Hi there! 👋

### Who am I?
I'm **M Ehteshamul Ghani**, also known as **Kabir**, a passionate Computer Science student exploring the endless possibilities of technology. With a strong foundation in **Python**, **C**, and **C++**, I enjoy building projects that bring ideas to life, combining logic with creativity.

As I continue my journey, I’m delving into the world of **web development**, learning to craft intuitive and functional user experiences. Whether it’s designing sleek interfaces or coding robust backends, I’m excited about creating impactful solutions for the web.

Beyond coding, I love sharing knowledge through small tutorials on YouTube, where I break down programming and development concepts into simple, digestible lessons. Everything I create proudly bears my tagline: *Made by Kabir*.
